- in order work with ansible we use adhoc commands
- ansible -i inv -m ping all
    - inv is inventroy file where host ip's are available -m is module, telling to use ping module and all tells to execute in all nodes in the inv file
- if the inventory file hasn't mentioned it will look for the hosts in /etc/ansible/hosts
